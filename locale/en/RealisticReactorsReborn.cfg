RRR-manually-check-neighbours=Disables the algorithm, that checks for connected reactors. Disable it on big maps with a lot of heat-pipes, when you experience lags while building your heat-pipe network.\nEnter "connect reactors" into the console (as admin) to start a check manually.
RRR-disable-vanilla-reactor=Removes the vanilla reactor from the game.
RRR-neighbour-check-delay=When you build your heat-pipe network, the neighbour check algorithm will start after this delay (in ticks).

RRR-reactor-starting-duration=The duration of the reactor starting phase in seconds.
RRR-energy_consumption_multiplier=Sets a multiplier for the energy consumption of the starting-phase, cooling and interface\nMin: 0, Default: 1.0, Max: 2.5 (Realistic: 2.5)
RRR-calculate-stats-function=This setting controls the power output and fuel efficiency of the reactors.\n\nHotter = Better gives you the maximum output and efficiency on the highest temperature (+10% per neighbour).\n\nWith "temperature sweetspot" you have to monitor the temperature more carefully. If you want to have a maximum output with good efficiency, you have to connect your reactors (max 4). On a single reactor the efficiency will drop quickly with high temperatures.\n\nSee the forum post or the included ODT-charts (-> mod folder) for more details on both modes.   
RRR-static-cooling-power-consumption=When static is chosen, the reactor will consume 1 MW while the core is being cooled by ECCS.\nOtherwise it will consume 1 MW per 20 MW of cooling.
RRR-scram-behaviour=limit to current cell = The reactor will slowly power down until the scam duration is over or the current fuel cell is depleted.\n\nstop half-empty = Reactor will take another fuel cell if current one depletes before scram duration is over. The cell will stay half-consumed in the reactor when it stops.\n\nconsume additional cell = Same as above but the cell will be depleted when the reactor stops.\n\ndecay heat (v1.0.x)= Current fuel is removed and decay heat is produced by script (like in version 1.0.x).
RRR-clouds_generation=When the reactor melts, it will emit radioactive clouds from the condensed water. The clouds will move over the map affected by the wind.\nSet a duration for how many seconds this will happen\n(0 - 100 - 9999999)

RRR-fallout-appearance=Invisible = You will only notice the contaminated area by the geiger-counter sound\n\nHalf-transparent = floating orange particles\n\nLess transparent = Same as above, but better visible\n\nGreen veil = The area will get colored green, but very hard to see in zones with low radiation
RRR-fallout-duration=Sets the duration (in seconds) how long fallout contamination will stay\n(1 - 600 - 9999999)
RRR-sarcophagus-duration=The time before a sarcophagus or ruin can be removed.
RRR-meltdown-mode=Choose what happens if your reactor reaches 1000°.\n\nNo meltdown = Nothing will happen, you don't need to worry about overheating your reactors.\n\nMeltdown = Your reactor will explode.\n\nRuin = After the explosion a reactor ruin will remain. It will produce radioactivity and radioactive clouds (depending on fallout mode setting). It can be removed after some time.\n\nRuin + Sarcophagus = You have to build a concrete sarcophagus over the reactor ruin to stop the fallout 'production'. The sarcophagus can be removed after some time.
RRR-meltdown-explosion=If you want, you can have a huge nuclear explosion during a reactor meltdown (real reactors don't explode, they melt... but hey, we're not judging you^^). \nThe regular explosion will only destroy the reactor, while the atomic explosion will also destroy an area around it.
RRR-fallout-mode=Choose the type of fallout, that occurs on a reactor meltdown.\n\nNo fallout = No radioactive clouds or fallout will occur. \n\nRadioactivity = The local area around the exploded reactor will be contaminated.\n\nClouds and radioactivity = Same as above, also radioactive clouds will appear, moving with the wind and contaminating the area around them.
RRR-eccs_power=The amount of cooling the eccs will provide under optimal circumstances
RRR-overlay-text=With "reactor name", a custom text can be entered in the top left of the GUIs.\n"temperature" will color the text after temperature.\n"temperature + rod" coloring will color the text like your control rods

RealisticReactors_Title=Congratulations! With this mod you have made your nuclear reactor setup a little bit more exciting!\n\n__CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__Realistic Reactors__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ [entity=RRR-realistic-reactor] produce heat and consume nuclear power cells just like the vanilla reactors. But their power output [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-power-output] and efficiency [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-efficiency] changes depending on the reactor core temperature [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-core-temp] and the reactor setup [virtual-signal=signal-neighbour-bonus]. \nAdditionally this mod introduces a __CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__Breeder Reactor__CONTROL_STYLE_END__ [entity=RRR-breeder-reactor]. Its operation is similar to the normal reactor and produces additional empty fuel cells while having a little less power output and efficiency.\n\nBoth reactors require proper cooling. If their core reaches 1000° a nuclear meltdown will occur. To prevent this the reactors have an integrated ECCS (Emergency Core Cooling System), where you can insert cold water to cool the reactor core. Cooling towers [entity=RRR-cooling-tower] are used to cool down the hot water or steam.
RealisticReactors_Operate=Stopping the reactor is called "scram".\nYou can start and stop the reactor with a button in the GUI or by "rotating" the reactor interface.\nThe GUI opens when you click the interface.\nAlternatively, a start or scram signal can be sent to the combinator
RealisticReactors_Meltdown=When the reactor reaches 1000° its core will melt.\nThis will cause the reactor to explode leaving behind a [entity=RRR-reactor-ruin].\nThe ruin will constantly produce radioactivity.\nTo stop the radioactivity, you need to build a [entity=RRR-reactor-sarcophagus] over the reactor ruin.\nAfter a long time (as seen in its health bar), the sarcophagus can be removed.\nThe only way to reduce the pollution is having Pollution modules permanently installed in the reactor. (These are not available in vanilla, you need an extra mod for that)
RealisticReactors_Output=[virtual-signal=signal-reactor-power-output], [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-efficiency] and [virtual-signal=signal-reactor-cell-bonus] change dynamically depending on the reactor core temperature.\n\n\n\n__CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__[Formula: "hotter = better"]__CONTROL_STYLE_END__\nGenerally this means, the hotter the better. (except with thorium fuel).\n\nI've categorized dozends of mod's fuel cells into these 4 behaviours:\n- Uranium has a very linear output/efficiency curve\n- Mox likes to be operated at very high temperatures\n- Plutonium is more forgiving at lower temperatures\n- Thorium even looses output/efficiency at higher temperatures\n\nUp to 3 Neighbours give a decent boost to efficiency and output. After that it's just 1% per additional neighbour.\nBreeder productivity also scales with temperature (except with thorium)\n\n\n\n\n\n__CONTROL_STYLE_BEGIN__[Formula: "temperature sweetspot"]__CONTROL_STYLE_END__\nThe general rule for power output and breeder bonus production is: the higher the temperature, the better. For the efficiency it's different: maximum efficiency is reached at a certain temperature, above and also below that point the efficiency is going to drop.\nEfficiency has a fixed minimum of 50%, and a fixed maximum of 200%.\n\nAll three values depend on the reactor setup, meaning the number of reactors connected by heat pipes (this feature replaces the vanilla neighbor bonus). The maximum is 4 connected reactors, the current state is visible in the [virtual-signal=signal-neighbour-bonus].\n\n1 Reactor: Efficiency sweetspot at 620°\n2 Reactors: Sweetspot 620-740°\n3 Reactors: Sweetspot 620-860°\n4 Reactors: 620-Inf°\n\nMore information comes with the mod, it is stored in the mod archive under DOCUMENTATION.

RealisticReactors_ECCS=The ECCS ("Emergency Core Cooling System") uses water to cool down the core directly.\nAttach pumps to each side and have them controlled by reactor temperature.\nWater flows from the fuller tank to the emptier one (any direction)
RealisticReactors_ControlRods=This system is entirely optional and needs to be researched before it gets available.\nThey increase or decrease power output on cost of efficiency and can be controlled via gui or with the "tachometer" signal\nIncreasing power is very quick, but reducing it takes longer\nAt lower temperatures, their operation is also much quicker\nIf you are brave, there's a setting that makes them also increase core temperature in an exponential way.
RealisticReactors_Quality=+10° max temperature per Reactor quality\n+10% cooling capabilities per Reactor quality\n+10% efficiency and power output per Reactor quality\n+10% efficiency per Fuel quality\n+10% control rod speed per Reactor quality
